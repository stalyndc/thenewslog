# Drawer Menu Fix

- Ensures the mobile drawer mirrors the full desktop navigation.
- Adds drawer initialization to the shared enhancement bootstrapping.
- Keeps the compiled `assets/app.js` bundle in sync with the TypeScript source.
- Adds cache-busting query parameters to static CSS/JS links so updates deploy reliably.
