    <p>
        The News Log runs a lean operation. We collect only the information needed to deliver
        the site, administer the newsletter (when enabled), and respond to messages you send us.
        Any optional data you share—such as tips, feedback, or your email address—is used solely
        for that conversation and never sold or swapped with third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our analytics are lightweight and aggregated; we review traffic trends to improve the
        experience, not to build individual profiles. Links on this site may point to external
        publications. Their privacy practices are outside our control, so please review their
        policies before sharing personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Have a privacy question or need your data removed? Write us at
        <a href="mailto:info@thenewslog.org">info@thenewslog.org</a> and we will follow up promptly.
        This policy may change as the product evolves; updates take effect as soon as they are posted.
