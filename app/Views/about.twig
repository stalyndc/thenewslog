        <h2>What is The News Log?</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
        The News Log is a daily, human‑curated briefing across tech, business, and culture.
        We scan reputable sources, pick the most useful pieces, and add one‑line context.
        No clickbait, no infinite feeds — just fast signal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each day we publish a compact edition you can browse in minutes. You can also explore
        past editions and topics when you want to go deeper. Newsletter options and more 
        discovery features are planned.

        This page will evolve — we’ll share more about our process, sourcing standards, and
        how to suggest links as we grow.
