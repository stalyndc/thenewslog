Here’s a focused codebase review with concrete fixes and improvements.

High‑Priority Bugs

Sitemap path mismatch:
Controller serves public/sitemap.xml, but README and generator output to project root.
Fix to read root file or change generator to write to public/.
Files: app/Controllers/SitemapController.php:9, scripts/generate_sitemap.php:59, README.md:46
Sitemap includes non‑existent route:
'/contact' is added but no page exists; remove or add page.
File: scripts/generate_sitemap.php:23
Env validation too strict for socket configs:
Requires DB_HOST even if DB_SOCKET is set; allow “host OR socket”.
File: app/Bootstrap/App.php:95
JSON body parsing can 500:
Request::fromGlobals() throws on invalid JSON; catch and return empty array to avoid breaking GET/POST flows with wrong content type.
File: app/Http/Request.php:53
Canonical link for RSS items:
RSS item <link>/channel link points to /?date=...; better canonical is /editions/{date}.
File: app/Controllers/RssController.php:35
Apache/Hostinger rewrite rules missing:
Without .htaccess, routes may 404. Add a front‑controller rewrite to route requests to index.php.
Security

Add CSP and modern security headers:
Set a default CSP that allows local assets, Google Fonts, and GTM; consider nonce for inline script in layout.
Add Permissions-Policy, Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy, Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy.
File: app/Http/Response.php:67 (extend applySecurityHeaders() or set per response in BaseController)
Don’t reveal exception messages in production:
index.php echoes the exception message; log it and render generic 500 page instead.
Files: index.php:16, app/Views/errors/500.twig:1
Session hardening:
Consider cookie_samesite='Strict' for admin endpoints, enable session.use_strict_mode=1, session.use_only_cookies=1.
File: index.php:10
CSRF coverage:
Looks good for POSTs. If POSTs are triggered by HTMX, consider adding a <meta name="csrf-token" ...> and default header for auto‑inclusion.
URL normalization and hashing:
Strip URL fragments before url_hash to avoid duplicates (example#123 vs example).
File: app/Services/FeedFetcher.php:76 and app/Helpers/Url.php:37
Reliability/Correctness

Feed fetch conditional headers:
You pass If‑None‑Match and modifiedSince correctly; nice.
SQL binds and pagination:
Generally safe. A few LIMIT integers are interpolated safely after bounds‑checking, which is OK.
Admin auth enforcement:
Enforced in AdminController constructor; consider removing the unused AuthMiddleware or implementing it for clarity.
Files: app/Controllers/Admin/AdminController.php:20, app/Middleware/AuthMiddleware.php:1
Rate limiter storage:
Uses serialize() with allowed_classes=false; safe. JSON might be simpler and more portable for debugging.
UX/SEO

Canonical URLs:
Add <link rel="canonical" ...> (home, edition, tag pages) to avoid duplicate content and filter /?date=... variants.
Files: app/Views/layout.twig:1, app/Controllers/HomeController.php:32
Use Response::cached():
Cache public pages (home, editions, tags, RSS) for short periods to reduce load.
Files: app/Controllers/HomeController.php:26, app/Controllers/EditionArchiveController.php:44, app/Controllers/TagController.php:21, app/Controllers/RssController.php:28
Head meta:
Add edition/tag specific <meta name="description"> if available for better snippets.
404/500:
Templates exist. Ensure controllers consistently use them (see 500 point above).
Observations on Code Quality

Twig autoescape on, minimal |raw usage limited to internal icon macros; safe.
Consistent prepared statements; transaction usage around reorder/move operations is good.
Encoding utilities and sanitization in curation view reduce risk from feed HTML.
Monolog logger registered; ensure logs capture bootstrap/cron exceptions as well.
Quick Fix Summary

Change sitemap path or generator output.
Soften env validation for sockets.
Wrap JSON parsing in try/catch; return [] on error.
Switch RSS canonical links to /editions/{date}.
Add .htaccess rewrite to front controller.
Add CSP + modern headers; hide exception messages from users.
Strip #fragment in URL normalization before hashing.
Suggested Patches (small, targeted)

SitemapController: read sitemap.xml in project root: thenewslog/sitemap.xml:1
App env validation: allow DB_HOST OR DB_SOCKET: app/Bootstrap/App.php:95
Request JSON parse guard: app/Http/Request.php:53
RSS canonical link: app/Controllers/RssController.php:35
Strip fragments pre‑hash: app/Helpers/Url.php:58 and app/Services/FeedFetcher.php:76
Add .htaccess with:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
If you want, I can apply the above safe patches and add a default CSP/header set. Would you like me to proceed?
