# Agent Notes â€” TheNewsLog.org

## Summary

- Scaffolded PHP 8.1 project with Composer autoloading, Twig views, and a lightweight router/container.
- Implemented Response/Request abstractions, 404 error handling, and Monolog logging.
- Added migration SQL (`scripts/migrate.sql`) defining tables for feeds, items, curated links, editions, tags, subscribers, and admin users.
- Introduced PDO bootstrap in `app/Bootstrap/App.php` and repository stubs (`app/Repositories/*`).

## Next Recommended Steps

1. Flesh out repository methods for retrieving and persisting feed/items data.
2. Implement admin authentication and session storage.
3. Connect controllers to repositories to power inbox/edition views.
4. Build RSS ingestion service using `FeedRepository` and `ItemRepository`.

## Environment Notes

- `.env.example` documents required configuration.
- Application logs write to `storage/logs/app.log`.
- Database credentials expected via `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`.
