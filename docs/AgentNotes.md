# Agent Notes â€” TheNewsLog.org

## Summary

- Scaffolded PHP 8.1 project with Composer autoloading, Twig views, and a lightweight router/container.
- Implemented Response/Request abstractions, 404 error handling, and Monolog logging.
- Added migration SQL (`scripts/migrate.sql`) defining tables for feeds, items, curated links, editions, tags, subscribers, and admin users.
- Introduced PDO bootstrap in `app/Bootstrap/App.php` and fleshed out repositories (`app/Repositories/*`) for feeds, items, and curated links.
- Controllers now pull real data where available (home stream, admin inbox/feeds/edition/curate) with Twig templates updated to render result sets gracefully when empty.
- Added session-based admin auth: `/admin` login, `/admin/logout`, protected admin controllers via `AdminController` base, and styled login form.
- Completed curation workflow: POST `/admin/curate/:id` saves curated links, auto-creates editions, and provides UI feedback.
- Implemented feed ingestion service using Feed-io + Guzzle, seed helper for default feeds, and cron script integration.
- Split Daily Edition vs Live Stream: home now shows today's published edition (with date badge) while `/stream` lists the full published history.
- Added tagging workflow: curate form accepts tags, tag pages (`/tags`, `/tags/{slug}`) render filtered streams, and links render tag pills.
- Added public RSS feeds (`/rss/daily.xml`, `/rss/stream.xml`) with head/footer links for discovery.
- Admin edition screen now supports manual reorder + publish/draft toggle.
- Public edition archive: `/editions` (paginated list) and `/editions/{date}` (full edition view) reuse linking/tag display.

## Next Recommended Steps

1. Flesh out feed management UI (CRUD, fail counts) and ingestion housekeeping (retry/backoff, logging dashboard).
2. Implement tag pages and public RSS endpoints sourced from curated links.
3. Build edition ordering tools (drag/drop or manual weight) and publish toggles.
4. Add automated tests/static analysis (PHPStan/PHPCS) for repositories and controllers.

## Environment Notes

- `.env.example` documents required configuration.
- Application logs write to `storage/logs/app.log`.
- Database credentials expected via `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`.
