# Agent Notes — TheNewsLog.org

## Summary

- Scaffolded PHP 8.1 project with Composer autoloading, Twig views, and a lightweight router/container.
- Implemented Response/Request abstractions, 404 error handling, and Monolog logging.
- Added migration SQL (`scripts/migrate.sql`) defining tables for feeds, items, curated links, editions, tags, subscribers, and admin users.
- Introduced PDO bootstrap in `app/Bootstrap/App.php` and fleshed out repositories (`app/Repositories/*`) for feeds, items, and curated links.
- Controllers now pull real data where available (home editions, admin inbox/feeds/edition/curate) with Twig templates updated to render result sets gracefully when empty.
- Added session-based admin auth: `/admin` login, `/admin/logout`, protected admin controllers via `AdminController` base, and styled login form.
- Completed curation workflow: POST `/admin/curate/:id` saves curated links, auto-creates editions, and provides UI feedback.
- Implemented feed ingestion service using Feed-io + Guzzle, seed helper for default feeds, and cron script integration.
- Simplified public flow around the Daily Edition; removed the legacy `/stream` page in favor of edition-first navigation.
- Added tagging workflow: curate form accepts tags, tag pages (`/tags`, `/tags/{slug}`) render filtered streams, and links render tag pills.
- Added public RSS feed (`/rss/daily.xml`) with legacy `/rss/stream.xml` redirecting for compatibility; head/footer include alternate link discovery.
- Admin edition screen now supports manual reorder + publish/draft toggle.
- Public edition archive: `/editions` (paginated list) and `/editions/{date}` (full edition view) reuse linking/tag display.
- Sitemap generator (`scripts/generate_sitemap.php`) now outputs `/sitemap.xml` covering editions, tags, and key routes.
- Admin header now surfaces inbox count + last fetch status when authenticated.
- `/admin/feeds` now includes full CRUD UI with inline flash messaging and quick navigation to/from the inbox.
- Admin toolbar refreshed with fetch, manage feeds, and logout shortcuts—including accent styling and section dividers.
- Inbox quick actions: curate shortcut, ignore (status change via htmx), and delete buttons; edition reorder offers drag-and-drop feedback.
- Admin alerts auto-dismiss after 10 seconds with fade-out animation.
- Added Heroicons-based edit/delete controls on public curated lists for admins.
- Default timezone set to `America/New_York` (overridable via `APP_TIMEZONE`).
- Embedded Google Analytics gtag snippet globally.
- Trimmed footer links pending redesigned About/section rollout.
- TODO (future): add email subscriber service integration once live (MailerSend/Mailgun or CSV export) to power footer subscribe form.
- TypeScript build scaffold added (`resources/ts/`, Vite config); bundle served as `/assets/app.js` (sticky masthead, reorder helper, timeago updates).

## Next Recommended Steps

1. Flesh out feed management UI (CRUD, fail counts) and ingestion housekeeping (retry/backoff, logging dashboard).
2. Implement tag pages and public RSS endpoints sourced from curated links.
3. Build edition ordering tools (drag/drop or manual weight) and publish toggles.
4. Add automated tests/static analysis (PHPStan/PHPCS) for repositories and controllers.

## Environment Notes

- `.env.example` documents required configuration.
- Application logs write to `storage/logs/app.log`.
- Database credentials expected via `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`.
- Process reminder for future agents: implement only the changes requested by the user or spec. Avoid adding extra routes, links, or UI elements unless explicitly instructed.
