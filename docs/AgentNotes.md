# Agent Notes â€” TheNewsLog.org

## Summary

- Scaffolded PHP 8.1 project with Composer autoloading, Twig views, and a lightweight router/container.
- Implemented Response/Request abstractions, 404 error handling, and Monolog logging.
- Added migration SQL (`scripts/migrate.sql`) defining tables for feeds, items, curated links, editions, tags, subscribers, and admin users.
- Introduced PDO bootstrap in `app/Bootstrap/App.php` and fleshed out repositories (`app/Repositories/*`) for feeds, items, and curated links.
- Controllers now pull real data where available (home stream, admin inbox/feeds/edition/curate) with Twig templates updated to render result sets gracefully when empty.

## Next Recommended Steps

1. Implement admin authentication and session storage.
2. Build the curation form flow (persist curated links, attach to editions, mark items curated).
3. Wire ingest service (Guzzle + Feed-io) to populate `items` through repositories.
4. Add read endpoints (stream RSS, sitemap) once edition publishing is solid.

## Environment Notes

- `.env.example` documents required configuration.
- Application logs write to `storage/logs/app.log`.
- Database credentials expected via `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`.
