Great question. Here's what I'd do if this were my project:
Phase 1: Stop & Stabilize (Week 1-2)

Remove/Pause:

    ❌ Stop adding features immediately
    ❌ No new admin dashboard improvements
    ❌ Put "nice to haves" on ice

Fix & Stabilize:

    ✅ Fix the Trix editor issues once and for all
    ✅ Make sure the core curation workflow is smooth
    ✅ Test the entire flow: RSS fetch → inbox → curate → publish → display
    ✅ Add basic error logging that emails me when cron jobs fail

Why: Your recent commits show you're fighting UI bugs. That means the foundation isn't solid yet. Stop building on shaky ground.
Phase 2: Choose My Lane (Week 3)

Pick ONE niche based on:

    What I actually read daily anyway
    What has sponsor potential
    What doesn't burn me out

My personal picks would be:

    "AI Tools for Builders" - Hot niche, lots of sponsors, interesting to follow
    "Indie SaaS Launches" - Product Hunt + IH, sponsors pay well
    "Developer Tools Weekly" - Always relevant, technical audience values curation

Add the right RSS feeds for that niche only. Remove generic tech feeds.

Update site messaging to reflect the niche (homepage, about page).
Phase 3: Simplify the Workflow (Week 4)

Make these changes to the app:

    Implement AI summarization properly:
        Use OpenAI API or Claude API (cheap: $0.01 per summary)
        Auto-generate 1-2 sentence blurbs for inbox items
        I just edit/approve, not write from scratch
        This saves 70% of curation time

    Add "Smart Inbox" filtering:
        Automatically score items by: domain authority, keywords, engagement
        Show me top 10 daily, hide the rest
        I pick 3-5 from the pre-filtered list

    Simplify edition creation:
        Remove: pinning, complex reordering
        Keep: basic order adjustment (up/down buttons)
        Default to "publish now" not scheduling

    Add basic analytics:
        Track: page views, email signups, popular stories
        Use simple self-hosted solution (Plausible or Umami)
        Helps me understand what resonates

Phase 4: Launch & Iterate (Ongoing)

Publishing schedule:

    Monday/Wednesday/Friday - 3 curated stories each
    Takes 15 mins per edition with AI help
    Sustainable for years

Content approach:

    Each story gets: headline (maybe rewritten), 1-2 sentence context, link
    No fluff, no trying to be clever
    Just helpful signal extraction

Growth strategy:

    Share on X/Twitter with good commentary (not just link dumping)
    Post to relevant subreddits when stories are genuinely valuable
    Cross-post to niche communities (IH, HN when appropriate)
    Goal: 50 email subscribers month 1, 200 by month 3

Monetization timeline:

    Months 1-6: Focus purely on quality + consistency
    Month 6-12: Start reaching out to niche SaaS tools for sponsorships
    Target: $500-1k/month once at 2-3k subscribers

Technical Additions I'd Make

High priority:

1. AI summarization integration (saves time)
2. Simple analytics (understand users)
3. Email sending via API (Resend/Mailgun) not just capture
4. Basic automated testing (prevent regressions)
5. RSS feed health monitoring (alert when feeds break)

Low priority / later:

- Social share cards (OpenGraph)
- Reading time estimates
- Better tag management
- Archive search

Technical Removals/Simplifications

- Remove complex pinning system (over-engineered)
- Simplify reordering to basic up/down
- Remove unused features in admin
- Consider removing scheduled publishing (just publish immediately)

How I'd Run It Day-to-Day

Morning routine (15 mins, 3x/week):

    Coffee + open admin dashboard
    Scan AI-pre-filtered inbox (top 10 items)
    Pick 3 best stories
    Quick edit AI blurbs (or approve as-is)
    Add tags, hit publish
    Done

Weekly admin (30 mins, Sundays):

    Check analytics - what's working?
    Review RSS feed health
    Engage with subscribers (reply to emails)
    Plan next week's topics if needed

Monthly review (1 hour):

    Analyze growth metrics
    Adjust content strategy based on data
    Update RSS feeds if needed
    Check for sponsor opportunities (once at scale)

My Philosophy

Sustainable > Perfect

    Rather publish 3 great stories 3x/week for years
    Than 10 mediocre stories daily for 3 months then burn out

Niche > Generic

    1,000 engaged subscribers in a niche = monetizable
    10,000 random tech readers = not monetizable

Automation > Manual Work

    Let AI do the first pass
    I add the human judgment (what matters, what doesn't)
    That's the value

Audience > Features

    No one cares about your fancy admin dashboard
    They care if you save them time finding good content
    Build for readers, not for yourself

TL;DR: If this were mine, I'd:

    Fix bugs, stop adding features
    Pick a specific niche (AI tools, indie SaaS, dev tools)
    Add AI summarization to reduce manual work
    Publish 3 stories, 3x/week (sustainable)
    Focus on quality + consistency for 6-12 months
    Start monetizing once at 2-3k engaged subscribers

The stack is fine. The codebase is fine. Just needs: focus + consistency + patience.

How We'll Work Through This

I'll help you execute each task. Here's what I need from you at each phase:

Phase 1 (Now):

    I'll start fixing bugs. You test and give feedback.

Phase 2 (After bugs fixed):

    You decide the niche. I'll help implement it.

Phase 3 (After niche chosen):

    You approve AI API choice. I'll build the features.

Phase 4 (After automation works):

    You approve email service. I'll integrate it.

Phase 5 (After everything works):

    You publish consistently. I support as needed.

Ready to Start?

Let's begin with Phase 1 - Bug Fixes.

Should I start with Task #1: Fixing the Trix editor issues?

I'll need to:

    Review the current Trix editor implementation
    Identify the width/layout issues from recent commits
    Fix them properly so you don't have to keep patching

Sound good?
