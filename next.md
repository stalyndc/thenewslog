Nice! Next sprint ideas when youâ€™re ready:

Flesh out the rest of the admin (edition reorder, inbox htmx actions, etc.) so curation feels snappier.
Add scheduling/publish controls to editions so you can prep a whole issue ahead of time.
Build lightweight analytics or feed health reporting to catch silent failures.
Draft an onboarding checklist (cron setup, seed process) so prod stays in sync.
Just say the word when you want to tackle one.
