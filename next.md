With the admin workflow smoothed out, I’d line up one of these next:

Edition scheduling – add draft/scheduled/published states plus a “go live at” picker so you can stage content and let cron flip editions automatically.

Onboarding/ops checklist – document cron jobs, deploy verification, seeding steps, and environment variables to keep prod + staging in sync.
Pick whichever fits your priorities (timed publishing, observability, or ops readiness) and we can dive in.
