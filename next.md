Nice! Next sprint ideas when youâ€™re ready:

Flesh out the rest of the admin (edition reorder, inbox htmx actions, etc.) so curation feels snappier.
Add scheduling/publish controls to editions so you can prep a whole issue ahead of time.
Build lightweight analytics or feed health reporting to catch silent failures.
Draft an onboarding checklist (cron setup, seed process) so prod stays in sync.
Just say the word when you want to tackle one.

## Completed updates (2025-10 cycle)

- Built full `/admin/feeds` CRUD UI with create/edit/delete forms, flash messaging, and inline navigation from inbox.
- Added admin toolbar shortcuts (fetch latest feeds, manage feeds, log out) and style polish.
- Introduced front-end quick actions for public curated links (admin-only pencil/delete icons).
- Wired quick actions on the admin inbox: curate shortcut, htmx ignore/delete buttons, and improved spacing/styling.
- Enabled drag-and-drop edition reordering with visual feedback and ensured positions auto-sync.
- Implemented 10-second auto-dismiss for admin alert banners with fade-out animation.
- Set application timezone default to `America/New_York` (overridable via `APP_TIMEZONE`).
- Embedded Google Analytics (gtag) snippet globally.
- Updated footer to remove placeholder navigation, pending future About/section work.
